# Introduction to Data Analysis: A Professional Framework

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on professional data analysis! This framework outlines the systematic approach used in industry to ensure reliable, interpretable, and actionable results. Whether you're working in healthcare, finance, marketing, or research, these principles form the foundation of sound analytical practice.

## I. Introduction and Goal Definition

### Goal Clarity and Dataset Definition

**Industry Alignment:** Goal clarity and dataset definition are key in any professional analysis. This mirrors how industry reports or executive summaries are structured.

**Key Components:**
- **Problem Statement:** Clearly define what question you're trying to answer
- **Success Metrics:** Establish how you'll measure success
- **Data Requirements:** Identify what data is needed and available
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Ensure all parties understand the objectives

**Example Framework:**
```python
# Define analysis objectives
analysis_goals = {
    "primary_question": "What factors influence customer retention?",
    "success_metrics": ["accuracy", "interpretability", "actionability"],
    "data_requirements": ["customer_demographics", "purchase_history", "interaction_data"],
    "stakeholders": ["marketing_team", "product_team", "executive_leadership"]
}
```

## II. Data Cleaning and Preparation

### Data Quality Assessment

**Industry Alignment:** Data cleaning is the foundation of reliable analysis. Poor data quality leads to poor decisions in any industry.

**Critical Steps:**
1. **Missing Value Analysis**
   ```python
   # Check for missing values
   missing_data = df.isnull().sum()
   missing_percentage = (missing_data / len(df)) * 100
   ```

2. **Data Type Validation**
   ```python
   # Ensure correct data types
   df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
   df['category'] = df['category'].astype('category')
   ```

3. **Outlier Detection**
   ```python
   # Identify outliers using IQR method
   Q1 = df['value'].quantile(0.25)
   Q3 = df['value'].quantile(0.75)
   IQR = Q3 - Q1
   outliers = df[(df['value'] < Q1 - 1.5*IQR) | (df['value'] > Q3 + 1.5*IQR)]
   ```

4. **Data Consistency Checks**
   ```python
   # Check for logical inconsistencies
   df['age'].describe()  # Should be reasonable range
   df['date'].min(), df['date'].max()  # Should be logical timeline
   ```

## III. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Comprehensive Data Exploration

**Industry Alignment:** EDA is essential in practice. Clear visuals and summaries help identify data quality issues, inform modeling, and communicate to stakeholders.

**Key Components:**

1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   ```python
   # Basic statistics
   summary_stats = df.describe()
   
   # Distribution analysis
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   
   plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
   plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
   df['target_variable'].hist()
   plt.title('Distribution of Target Variable')
   
   plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
   sns.boxplot(y=df['target_variable'])
   plt.title('Box Plot - Outlier Detection')
   ```

2. **Correlation Analysis**
   ```python
   # Correlation matrix
   correlation_matrix = df.corr()
   sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
   ```

3. **Quick Normality Assessment**
   ```python
   # Brief normality check for key variables
   from scipy import stats
   
   def quick_normality_check(data, variable_name):
       """
       Quick normality assessment for EDA purposes
       """
       shapiro_stat, shapiro_p = stats.shapiro(data)
       print(f"{variable_name}: W={shapiro_stat:.3f}, p={shapiro_p:.3f}")
       return shapiro_p > 0.05
   
   # Check key variables
   print("=== Quick Normality Check ===")
   is_normal = quick_normality_check(df['target_variable'], 'Target Variable')
   print(f"Appears normal: {is_normal}")
   print("Note: Detailed testing will be done in Statistical Analysis section")
   ```

4. **Feature Relationships**
   ```python
   # Scatter plots for key relationships
   plt.scatter(df['feature1'], df['target'])
   plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
   plt.ylabel('Target Variable')
   plt.title('Feature vs Target Relationship')
   ```

**Interpretation:** Show analytical thinking beyond just running code by explaining what patterns mean and their business implications.

**Note on Normality Testing:** The quick normality check in EDA provides early insights to guide analysis decisions, while formal testing in the Statistical Analysis section ensures proper validation for reporting and model assumptions.

## IV. Model Selection

### Systematic Approach to Model Choice

**Industry Alignment:** Discussing selection techniques (like stepwise, AIC/BIC, regularization) is very common. Justifying model choice is critical in regulated fields (e.g., healthcare, finance).

**Selection Criteria:**

1. **Problem Type Classification**
   - **Regression:** Continuous target variable
   - **Classification:** Categorical target variable
   - **Time Series:** Temporal dependencies
   - **Clustering:** Unsupervised grouping

2. **Model Complexity vs. Interpretability**
   ```python
   # Model comparison framework
   models = {
       'linear_regression': {'complexity': 'low', 'interpretability': 'high'},
       'random_forest': {'complexity': 'medium', 'interpretability': 'medium'},
       'neural_network': {'complexity': 'high', 'interpretability': 'low'}
   }
   ```

3. **Selection Techniques**
   ```python
   # Stepwise selection
   from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   
   # AIC/BIC for model comparison
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
   import numpy as np
   
   def calculate_aic(n, mse, k):
       return n * np.log(mse) + 2*k
   ```

## V. Model Diagnostics

### Assumption Validation and Quality Checks

**Industry Alignment:** Checking assumptions is fundamental for interpretable models like linear regression. Identification of outliers and influential points is directly applicable in fraud detection, quality control, etc.

**Diagnostic Tests:**

1. **Linear Regression Assumptions**
   ```python
   # Normality of residuals using Shapiro-Wilk test
   from scipy import stats
   residuals = y_true - y_pred
   
   # Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
   shapiro_stat, shapiro_p = stats.shapiro(residuals)
   print(f"Shapiro-Wilk Test Statistic: {shapiro_stat:.4f}")
   print(f"P-value: {shapiro_p:.4f}")
   print(f"Residuals are normal: {shapiro_p > 0.05}")
   
   # Alternative: Q-Q plot for visual assessment (less reliable)
   stats.probplot(residuals, dist="norm", plot=plt)
   plt.title('Q-Q Plot of Residuals (Visual Assessment Only)')
   
   # Homoscedasticity
   plt.scatter(y_pred, residuals)
   plt.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='--')
   plt.xlabel('Predicted Values')
   plt.ylabel('Residuals')
   plt.title('Residual Plot')
   ```
   
   **Note:** The Shapiro-Wilk test is preferred over Q-Q plots because it provides a quantitative, objective measure of normality. Q-Q plots can be misleading due to subjective interpretation and human bias in pattern recognition.

2. **Outlier and Influence Analysis**
   ```python
   # Cook's Distance for influence
   from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import OLSInfluence
   influence = OLSInfluence(model)
   cooks_d = influence.cooks_distance[0]
   ```

3. **Multicollinearity Check**
   ```python
   # Variance Inflation Factor
   from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor
   
   def calculate_vif(X):
       vif_data = pd.DataFrame()
       vif_data["Variable"] = X.columns
       vif_data["VIF"] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
       return vif_data
   ```

4. **Formal Normality Testing**
   ```python
   # Comprehensive Shapiro-Wilk testing for statistical validation
   from scipy import stats
   
   def formal_normality_test(data, variable_name):
       """
       Formal normality testing for statistical analysis and reporting
       """
       shapiro_stat, shapiro_p = stats.shapiro(data)
       
       print(f"=== Formal Normality Test for {variable_name} ===")
       print(f"Shapiro-Wilk Test Statistic: {shapiro_stat:.4f}")
       print(f"P-value: {shapiro_p:.4f}")
       print(f"Is normal (α=0.05): {shapiro_p > 0.05}")
       
       # Detailed interpretation
       if shapiro_p > 0.05:
           print("✓ Data appears to follow normal distribution")
           print("✓ Parametric tests are appropriate")
           print("✓ Linear regression assumptions may be met")
       else:
           print("✗ Data does not follow normal distribution")
           print("✗ Consider non-parametric alternatives")
           print("✗ Transform data or use robust methods")
       
       return shapiro_stat, shapiro_p
   
   # Test all key variables for formal reporting
   print("=== Statistical Analysis: Normality Testing ===")
   test_normality(df['target_variable'], 'Target Variable')
   test_normality(df['feature1'], 'Feature 1')
   test_normality(df['feature2'], 'Feature 2')
   ```
   
   **Purpose of Formal Testing:**
- **Statistical validation:** Formal hypothesis testing for model assumptions
- **Reporting standards:** Required for publication and professional documentation
- **Decision making:** Determines appropriate statistical methods
- **Quality assurance:** Ensures analytical rigor

**Why Shapiro-Wilk is the Gold Standard:**
The Shapiro-Wilk test is considered the gold standard for normality testing because it:
- **Quantitative measure:** Provides objective statistical measure rather than subjective visual interpretation
- **Statistical power:** More powerful than other normality tests for detecting departures from normality
- **Comprehensive assessment:** Accounts for the entire distribution, not just specific quantiles
- **Robustness:** Less sensitive to sample size variations than visual methods
- **Reliability:** Less prone to human bias and pattern recognition errors that can occur with Q-Q plots

While Q-Q plots can be misleading due to human bias in interpretation and the tendency to see patterns where none exist, the Shapiro-Wilk test gives us a clear, statistical answer about whether our data meets the normality assumption required for parametric tests.

## VI. Analysis and Interpretation

### Results Communication and Business Impact

**Industry Alignment:** Reporting statistical metrics and tying them back to the business or research question is crucial. Many real-world failures happen because of misinterpreting the results—this section helps prevent that.

**Interpretation Framework:**

1. **Statistical Significance**
   ```python
   # P-values and confidence intervals
   from scipy import stats
   
   # T-test example
   t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2)
   print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}")
   print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
   print(f"Significant at 5% level: {p_value < 0.05}")
   ```

2. **Effect Size and Practical Significance**
   ```python
   # Cohen's d for effect size
   def cohens_d(group1, group2):
       pooled_std = np.sqrt(((len(group1) - 1) * group1.var() + 
                           (len(group2) - 1) * group2.var()) / 
                           (len(group1) + len(group2) - 2))
       return (group1.mean() - group2.mean()) / pooled_std
   ```

3. **Business Impact Translation**
   ```python
   # Convert statistical results to business metrics
   def business_impact(model_coefficient, feature_change, baseline_value):
       predicted_change = model_coefficient * feature_change
       percentage_change = (predicted_change / baseline_value) * 100
       return f"Changing {feature_change} units results in {percentage_change:.1f}% change"
   ```
