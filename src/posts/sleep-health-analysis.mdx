### I. Goal Definition

**Primary Research Question:** What factors most significantly influence sleep quality and duration?

**Secondary Questions:**
- How do lifestyle factors (physical activity, stress) correlate with sleep patterns?
- Are there significant demographic differences in sleep patterns?
- What is the relationship between sleep duration and sleep quality?

**Success Metrics:** Statistical significance, interpretability, and actionability of findings.

### II. Data Cleaning and Preparation

The analysis began with comprehensive data quality assessment:

1. **Missing Value Analysis:** Identified and documented any missing data points
2. **Data Type Validation:** Ensured proper data types for categorical and numerical variables
3. **Outlier Detection:** Used IQR method to identify and handle outliers systematically
4. **Data Consistency Checks:** Verified logical ranges for all variables
    
### III. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Distribution Analysis

### Sleep Duration Distribution

Understanding the distribution of sleep duration across the population helps identify normal ranges and potential sleep issues. The histogram shows the frequency distribution, while the box plot reveals outliers and quartiles.

### Normality Test (Shapiro-Wilk)

Note: The Shapiro-Wilk test is a formal test for normality that's more reliable than visual assessments like Q-Q plots. While Q-Q plots can sometimes give the illusion of normality, the Shapiro-Wilk test provides a quantitative, objective measure of how well the data follows normal distribution. We will quickly explore this data's normality, in contrast to the QQ plot above.

**Shapiro-Wilk Test Results:**
- **Test Statistic:** 0.987
- **P-value:** 0.0023

**Interpretation:** With a p-value < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the data follows a normal distribution, indicating that non-parametric methods may be more appropriate for this analysis.

## Correlation Analysis

### Sleep Duration vs Quality

This scatter plot explores the relationship between sleep duration and sleep quality. Understanding this correlation is crucial for optimizing sleep patterns.

### Correlation Matrix

The correlation heatmap shows relationships between all numeric variables in the dataset. Red indicates positive correlations, blue indicates negative correlations, and white indicates no correlation.

## Demographic Analysis

### Sleep Patterns by Age Groups

Age can significantly impact sleep patterns. This analysis shows how sleep duration, quality, physical activity, and stress levels vary across different age groups.

### Sleep Patterns by Gender

Gender differences in sleep patterns are well-documented. This analysis compares sleep duration, quality, stress levels, and physical activity between males and females.

### Sleep Duration by Occupation

Different occupations may have varying demands and schedules that affect sleep patterns. This analysis shows average sleep duration across different professional categories.

## Lifestyle Factors Impact

### Impact of Lifestyle Factors on Sleep

Lifestyle choices significantly influence sleep quality and duration. This analysis explores how physical activity, stress levels, daily steps, and heart rate correlate with sleep patterns.

### IV. Statistical Analysis and Modeling

## Statistical Tests

### Normality Testing
- **Shapiro-Wilk Test:** Applied to assess normality of sleep duration distribution
- **Results:** Determined whether parametric or non-parametric tests were appropriate

### Correlation Analysis
- **Pearson Correlation:** Measured linear relationships between sleep duration and quality
- **Statistical Significance:** P-values calculated to determine meaningful relationships

### Group Comparisons
- **T-tests:** Compared sleep patterns between gender groups
- **Effect Sizes:** Cohen's d calculated to assess practical significance

## Linear Regression Modeling

### Model Development
A linear regression model was developed to predict sleep quality based on multiple factors:

**Predictor Variables:**
- Age
- Physical Activity Level
- Stress Level
- Heart Rate
- Daily Steps

**Model Performance Metrics:**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)
- Model coefficients and their significance

### Model Diagnostics

**Residual Analysis:**
The model diagnostics include comprehensive residual analysis to validate linear regression assumptions:

- **Homoscedasticity Check:** Residuals vs Predicted plots to verify constant variance
- **Normality Assessment:** Shapiro-Wilk test on residuals for normal distribution
- **Residual Distribution:** Histograms and Q-Q plots for visual assessment

**Multicollinearity Check:**
- Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) calculated
- Ensured no problematic correlations between predictors
