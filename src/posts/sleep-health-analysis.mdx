# Sleep Health & Lifestyle Analysis: A Comprehensive Data Study

This analysis explores the relationship between sleep patterns and various lifestyle factors using a dataset of sleep health and lifestyle information. Following professional data analysis frameworks, this study systematically examines sleep duration, quality, and their correlations with physical activity, stress levels, occupation, age, and gender through rigorous statistical methods.

## Analysis Framework

### I. Introduction and Goal Definition

**Primary Research Question:** What factors most significantly influence sleep quality and duration?

**Secondary Questions:**
- How do lifestyle factors (physical activity, stress) correlate with sleep patterns?
- Are there significant demographic differences in sleep patterns?
- What is the relationship between sleep duration and sleep quality?

**Success Metrics:** Statistical significance, interpretability, and actionability of findings.

### II. Data Cleaning and Preparation

The analysis began with comprehensive data quality assessment:

1. **Missing Value Analysis:** Identified and documented any missing data points
2. **Data Type Validation:** Ensured proper data types for categorical and numerical variables
3. **Outlier Detection:** Used IQR method to identify and handle outliers systematically
4. **Data Consistency Checks:** Verified logical ranges for all variables

### III. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Distribution Analysis

### Sleep Duration Distribution

Understanding the distribution of sleep duration across the population helps identify normal ranges and potential sleep issues. The histogram shows the frequency distribution, while the box plot reveals outliers and quartiles.

### Normality Test (QQ Plot)

The Q-Q plot tests whether sleep duration follows a normal distribution. Points following the red line indicate normal distribution, while deviations suggest non-normal patterns.

## Correlation Analysis

### Sleep Duration vs Quality

This scatter plot explores the relationship between sleep duration and sleep quality. Understanding this correlation is crucial for optimizing sleep patterns.

## Linear Regression Modeling

### Model Development
A linear regression model was developed to predict sleep quality based on multiple factors:

**Predictor Variables:**
- Age
- Physical Activity Level
- Stress Level
- Heart Rate
- Daily Steps

**Model Performance Metrics:**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)
- Model coefficients and their significance

### Model Diagnostics

**Residual Analysis:**
- Residuals vs Predicted plots for homoscedasticity
- QQ plots for normality of residuals
- Residual distribution histograms

**Multicollinearity Check:**
- Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) calculated
- Ensured no problematic correlations between predictors
